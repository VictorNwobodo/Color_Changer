DESCRIPTION: 
this project helps user to switch colors randomly rather than sequently and the inspiration behind this project was to practice the full concept of using the array method to store the colors, 
The Function expression to store the codes to be runed untill a certain point, then it also has to do with the variables, Math.random, the length of an array
and also this project has connection with the HTML using the document object model to target the Html interactivity and to set properties to function
basicall i tried learning how to set the addEventListener that when user clicks the button that says "Check Me Out!" the backgroundColor will
equally change it's color to a new color randomly.
